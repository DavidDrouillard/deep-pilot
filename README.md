# Deep pilot
A Raspberry Pi based model vehicle driven by deep convolutional neural network.

## Branches
The branches represent where the code runs: there is an `rpi` branch for the vehicle and there are `pc`-annotated branches for different language realizations, e.g. `pc-csharp` for the c# based application. 

`git clone -b rpi https://github.com/horverno/deep-pilot`

`git clone -b pc-csharp https://github.com/horverno/deep-pilot`
